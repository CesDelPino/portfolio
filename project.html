    <h2> The low down:</h2> <p>I have already got a quote off fiverr for 150 bucks based of 10 hours work (in a developing nation). Its not much but I'd rather give it to the class. Maybe one of you or two people in the class. So you wont get a massive payday. I guess its more for your portfolio in building a real world project.</p>
    <h2> The brief:</h2> <br>
    <p>I am reviewing some manuals...they have some mistakes.. </p>
    <p>I need to deploy an app that lets a team make a record for each mistake in a document. Each record would need a document reference (a paragraph number e.g. 1.2.34.a)/ the original text(people would cut and paste large data) / an error type / a comment / 
    a revision suggestion (could also be a large cut and paste)/ created by / and timestamp,  these are all string fields.</p>
    <p>The important bit: each entry needs an approved status and an incorporated column which would be boolenas.</p>
    <p>It also needs devise for user auth. A single user class is probably enough</p>

    <p>Aside for CRUD capability for each entry, the only real magic is that I need a view that displays all the entries that have been aproved for change but not yet incorporated.
    we will send this to the document amendment team to change the manuals.
    I need the same database for 3 manuals</p>
    <p>Timing for a MVP is ASAP as usual</p>
    <p>Styling is not important (except for your own portfolio), and scafolding would probably do the job.</p>
