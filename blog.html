            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled 
            and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot 
            foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail 
            in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil
             and pain. 
            These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice 
            is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure 
            is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
