            So...... little over 7 weeks ago, I started a fulltime, full-stack developer
            course at <a href="CoderAcademy.com.au">CoderAcademy.com.au</a>, three days ago
            ago we handed in our third assessment. Not going to lie, its been tough. I went from
            thinking I knew a bit of html, to building this site from scratch. Every line of code
            is mine. It's not perfect by any means, but its mine. The sense of fullfilment from having
            built my own little piece of the web is amazing. Not only that, but I just completed my 
            first fully functioning app. It only works in the terminal, and doesn't do very much tbh. However, 
            it does let me think that I can actually build more complex stuff. Actually, now I know I can.
            We used ruby to make it, and yes I didn't know ruby at the start either. The joys of
            being a mature student have made it challenging to manage my time, yet its only thanks to
            COVID-19 that I can have started this course at all. Yes I lost my well paid job, but 
            its also allowed me to do something I've been wanting to do for a long time. I mean,
            I started coding lessons before my lecturers were born. I learnt 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">LOGO</a> at around 9yrs old.
            The challenges for the coming term are going to be as big if not bigger... but I'm keen.
            I haven't felt like this for a long long time.

            PS. My 3 girls chose the colour scheme for the site. I had originally 
            made it a sky-blue theme since it refelcts who I am. I couldnt say no to the five year old who
            wanted salmon-pink.
